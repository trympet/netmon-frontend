# SimpleNetmon

A simple webgui for monitoring devices with SNMP. Allows for grouping, and adding custom MIBs (yay!) to groups.

You can see devices at a quick glance, or you can get more in-deapth information about a certain device, including interface traffic, IP-addresses etc. 

It is built with the intent of removing all the "fluff" from other SNMP monitoring services, such as Observium. Therefore it is easy to find the information you want without having to navigate though dosens of menus.

It is built to work with a restful backend with an SQL database. 

This project was also generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
